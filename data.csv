Release managers can adjust specific dates as needed. feature : Before the first beta, the next full release can accept new features, bug fixes, and security fixes. prerelease : After the first beta, no new features can go in, but feature fixes (including significant changes to new features), bug fixes, and security fixes are accepted for the upcoming feature release. bugfix : Once a version has been fully released, bug fixes and security fixes are accepted. New binaries are built and released roughly every two months. This phase is also called maintenance mode or stable release. security : After two years (18 months for versions before 3.13), only security fixes are accepted and no more binaries are released. New source-only versions can be released as needed. end-of-life : Five years after a release, support ends. The release cycle is frozen; no further changes are allowed. See also the Development cycle (../developer-workflow/development-cycle/#devcycle) page for more information about branches and backporting.","[{'version': '3.15', 'status': 'feature', 'first_release': '2026-10-01', 'end_of_life': '2031-10'}, {'version': '3.14', 'status': 'prerelease', 'first_release': '2025-10-07', 'end_of_life': '2030-10'}, {'version': '3.13', 'status': 'bugfix', 'first_release': '2024-10-07', 'end_of_life': '2029-10'}, {'version': '3.12', 'status': 'security', 'first_release': '2023-10-02', 'end_of_life': '2028-10'}, {'version': '3.11', 'status': 'security', 'first_release': '2022-10-24', 'end_of_life': '2027-10'}, {'version': '3.10', 'status': 'security', 'first_release': '2021-10-04', 'end_of_life': '2026-10'}, {'version': '3.9', 'status': 'security', 'first_release': '2020-10-05', 'end_of_life': '2025-10'}, {'version': '3.8', 'status': 'end-of-life', 'first_release': '2019-10-14', 'end_of_life': '2024-10-07'}, {'version': '3.7', 'status': 'end-of-life', 'first_release': '2018-06-27', 'end_of_life': '2023-06-27'}, {'version': '3.6', 'status': 'end-of-life', 'first_release': '2016-12-23', 'end_of_life': '2021-12-23'}, {'version': '3.5', 'status': 'end-of-life', 'first_release': '2015-09-13', 'end_of_life': '2020-09-30'}, {'version': '3.4', 'status': 'end-of-life', 'first_release': '2014-03-16', 'end_of_life': '2019-03-18'}, {'version': '3.3', 'status': 'end-of-life', 'first_release': '2012-09-29', 'end_of_life': '2017-09-29'}, {'version': '3.2', 'status': 'end-of-life', 'first_release': '2011-02-20', 'end_of_life': '2016-02-20'}, {'version': '3.1', 'status': 'end-of-life', 'first_release': '2009-06-27', 'end_of_life': '2012-04-09'}, {'version': '3.0', 'status': 'end-of-life', 'first_release': '2008-12-03', 'end_of_life': '2009-06-27'}, {'version': '2.7', 'status': 'end-of-life', 'first_release': '2010-07-03', 'end_of_life': '2020-01-01'}, {'version': '2.6', 'status': 'end-of-life', 'first_release': '2008-10-01', 'end_of_life': '2013-10-29'}]"

Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable latest supported downloads 2025-05-28 Feedback The Visual C++ Redistributable installs Microsoft C and C++ (MSVC) runtime libraries. Many applications built using Microsoft C and C++ tools require these libraries. If your app uses those libraries, a Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable package must be installed on the target system before you install your app. The Redistributable package architecture must match your app's target architecture. The Redistributable version must be at least as recent as the MSVC build toolset used to build your app. We recommend you use the latest Redistributable available for your version of Visual Studio, with some exceptions noted later in this article. Distribution of the Visual C++ Runtime Redistributable package, merge modules, and individual binaries is limited to licensed Visual Studio users and is subject to such License Terms. For details on how to install and redistribute Visual Studio components, see Redistributing Visual C++ Files (redistributing-visual-cpp-files?view=msvc-170) . Visual Studio 2015, 2017, 2019, and 2022 This table lists the latest supported English (en-US) Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable packages for Visual Studio 2015, 2017, 2019, and 2022. The latest supported version has the most recently implemented C++ features, security, reliability, and performance improvements. It also includes the latest C++ standard language and library standards conformance updates. We recommend that you install this version for all applications created using Visual Studio 2015, 2017, 2019, or 2022. Unlike older versions of Visual Studio, which have infrequent redist updates, the version number isn't listed in the following table for Visual Studio 2015-2022 because the redist is updated frequently. To find the version number of the latest redist, download the redist you're interested in using one of the following links. Then, look at its properties using Windows File Explorer. In the Details pane, the File version contains the version of the redist. Latest Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable version The latest version is v14.44.35211.0 Use the following links to download this version for each supported architecture: Architecture Link Notes ARM64 https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.arm64.exe (https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.arm64.exe) Permalink for latest supported ARM64 version X86 https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x86.exe (https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x86.exe) Permalink for latest supported x86 version X64 https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe (https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) Permalink for latest supported x64 version. The X64 Redistributable package contains both ARM64 and X64 binaries. This package makes it easy to install required Visual C++ ARM64 binaries when the X64 Redistributable is installed on an ARM64 device. Download other versions, including long term servicing release channel (LTSC) versions, from my.visualstudio.com (https://my.visualstudio.com/) . Notes The Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015-2022 doesn't have separate packages for different languages. It contains EULAs for all supported languages. Some of the downloads that are mentioned in this article are currently available on my.visualstudio.com (https://my.visualstudio.com/) . Log in using a Visual Studio Subscription account so that you can access the download links. If you're asked for credentials, use your existing Visual Studio subscription account. Or, create a free account by choosing the No account? Create one! link. Visual Studio versions since Visual Studio 2015 share the same Redistributable files. For example, any apps built by the Visual Studio 2015, 2017, 2019, or 2022 toolsets can use the latest Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable. However, the version of the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable installed on the machine must be the same or higher than the version of the Visual C++ toolset used to create your application. For more information about which version of the Redistributable to install, see Determining which DLLs to redistribute (determining-which-dlls-to-redistribute?view=msvc-170) . For more information about binary compatibility, see C++ binary compatibility between Visual Studio versions (../porting/binary-compat-2015-2017?view=msvc-170) . Windows XP Support : Microsoft ended support for Windows XP on April 8, 2014. Current versions of the Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015-2022 only support Windows 7, 8.1, 10, and 11. The last version of the Visual C++ Redistributable that works on Windows XP shipped in Visual Studio 2019 version 16.7 (file versions starting with 14.27 ). The Redistributable is available in the my.visualstudio.com Downloads (https://my.visualstudio.com/Downloads/) section as Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2019 (version 16.7) . Use the Search box to find this version. To download the files, select the platform and language you need, and then choose the Download button. The Visual C++ Redistributable supports several command-line options. For more information, see Command-line options for the Redistributable packages (redistributing-visual-cpp-files?view=msvc-170#command-line-options-for-the-redistributable-packages) .
