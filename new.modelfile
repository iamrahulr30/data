Release managers can adjust specific dates as needed. feature : Before the first beta, the next full release can accept new features, bug fixes, and security fixes. prerelease : After the first beta, no new features can go in, but feature fixes (including significant changes to new features), bug fixes, and security fixes are accepted for the upcoming feature release. bugfix : Once a version has been fully released, bug fixes and security fixes are accepted. New binaries are built and released roughly every two months. This phase is also called maintenance mode or stable release. security : After two years (18 months for versions before 3.13), only security fixes are accepted and no more binaries are released. New source-only versions can be released as needed. end-of-life : Five years after a release, support ends. The release cycle is frozen; no further changes are allowed. See also the Development cycle (../developer-workflow/development-cycle/#devcycle) page for more information about branches and backporting.
