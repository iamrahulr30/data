Policy on information provided in Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts As a matter of policy, Oracle will not provide additional information about the specifics of vulnerabilities beyond what is provided in the Critical Patch Update or Security Alert notification, the pre-installation notes, the readme files, and FAQs. Oracle provides all customers with the same information in order to protect all customers equally. Oracle will not provide advance notification or "insider information" on Critical Patch Update or Security Alerts to individual customers. Finally, Oracle does not distribute exploit code (or "proof of concept code") for vulnerabilities in our products. Applicability of Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts to Oracle Cloud The Oracle Cloud operations and security teams regularly evaluate Oracle’s Critical Patch Updates and Security Alert fixes as well as relevant third-party fixes as they become available and apply the relevant patches in accordance with applicable change management processes. Cloud customers requiring information that is not addressed in the Critical Patch Update Advisory may obtain information as follows: Oracle Cloud (IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS) customers should submit a SR within their designated support system Oracle Managed Cloud Services (OMCS) customers should contact their Service Delivery Manager (SDM) or Technical Account Manager (TAM) CRM On Demand customers should request status via a Service Request (SR) Global Business Units/Industry Cloud Services customers should submit a SR within their designated support system or, if applicable, contact their Customer Success Manager Oracle Advertising customers should contact their Client Partner. Oracle NetSuite customers should submit an Oracle NetSuite Support Case from within their Oracle NetSuite account.
